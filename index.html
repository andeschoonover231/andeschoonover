      Hello! My name is Ande. I'm a student at EWU that's a little terrified to
      graduate this June... completely online. It's a bummer. I'm hoping that my
      network won't be permenantly stunted, espcially considering I'll have
      spent over 80% of my college career online, thanks to running start.
